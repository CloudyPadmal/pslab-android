# PSLab Android App

Repository for the PSLab Android App for performing experiments with the [Pocket Science Lab](https://pslab.io) open-hardware platform.

If you are reading this message, then you are in Padmal's mydevelopment branch where the sole purpose of this branch is to generate apk files for the code developed. It should be regularly sync'ed with the upstream development branch using git fetch and git pull. The commits are not to be ever made as a pull request. Use git reset --soft upstream/development to reset the work head and have only one commit ahead of the upstream development branch.

This repository holds the Android App for performing experiments with [PSLab](https://pslab.io/). PSLab is a tiny pocket science lab that provides an array of equipment for doing science and engineering experiments. It can function like an oscilloscope, waveform generator, frequency counter, programmable voltage and current source and also as a data logger. Our website is at https://pslab.io
